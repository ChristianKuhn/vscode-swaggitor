# Swaggitor - Swagger extension for Visual Studio

This extension validates YAML or JSON Swagger API definitions.

Current features are:
- Validate YAML and JSON files.
- Files are validated upon saving.
- Shows syntax and indentation errors.

Support for code completion is implemented, but we still lack a list of Swagger keywords containing:
- keywords
- short desciption
- documentation

It is still a little rough around the edges, so feel free to report problems and bugs or contribute ;-).
